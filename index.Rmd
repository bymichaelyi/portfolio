# About {.unnumbered #about}

#### Greeting, I'm Michael and welcome to my portfolio. I do writing, editing and teaching but I'm always up for more.  {-}

#### Bio {-}

Growing up thinking of STEM as more inherently honourable than arts, I was originally in the Faculty of Science at the University of British Columbia studying Biochemistry before transferring to the English Literature Program. It was not as though my love of English was new, my best memories of high school were participating in Slam Poetry events and attending the seminar of the same novelist every year during career day. If I go even further back, I remember publishing my first fanfiction online when I was 12 years old, less than half a year after I began learning English. 

After using up all of my first year electives on English and Creative Writing classes and spending most of my free time in writing groups, I realised I already knew what I wanted to do with my life; I just wasn't doing it. I still think there is honour to the natural sciences, to discovering the working of the world and helping people through research in medicine, but I also know the biggest difference I could make would be made doing what I'm good at and what I'm passionate about. 

I began working as a freelance editor, editing works in any genre in my first year as an English major, helping publish novels, poetry collections, picture books and essays. I already did the same thing as a hobby before, so, with new academic knowledge, transitioning into doing it professionally was not a challenge. As a bonus, the experiences prepared me for publishing my own works, be it the self-published short stories and poems during my degree or my autoethnographic essay, recently published in the journal Biography Lives of the University of Hawai'i.

Though I have no intention to doubt the prestige of traditional publishing, my current interests are still in the new mediums and the new ways stories can be told. I have worked as a narrative designer on games and experimented on different platforms such as Twine, Tales, Texture Writer, Story Map JS and R Bookdown (which is what this website is built in).  

Currently, I'm looking for a full-time position where my affinity for writing can come into play. Let me know, I'm up for most things.
